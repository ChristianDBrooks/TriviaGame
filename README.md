# TriviaGame

In this trivia game assignment I decided to take a very corporate test or questionare looke to the game. To simulate createing the same thing for a business or company in the future. I wanted it to look fairly professional. So naturally my theme for questions followed suit asking questions about corporate america.

I used a lot of javascript and same jquery to complete this assignment, but relied some on boostrap and the "d-none" class which hides elements. By manipulating the HTML I managed to complete a lot of the behind the scenes working of displaying and hiding parts of text.

The finished product is a very simple and sleek designed quiz on what you know. At the end it will tell you the number of questions answered correctly, answered incorrectly, not answered at all.
